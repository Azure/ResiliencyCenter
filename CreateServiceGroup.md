# Create a service group

Azure Service Groups offer a flexible way to organize and manage resources across subscriptions and resource groups, parallel to any existing Azure resource hierarchy. They're ideal for scenarios requiring cross-boundary grouping, minimal permissions, and aggregations of data across resources. These features empower teams to create tailored resource collections that align with operational, organizational, or persona-based needs.

## Overview

Key capabilities of service groups include:

- **Multiple hierarchies**: Service Groups enable scenarios where resources can be grouped in different views for multiple purposes. The same resources can be connected to many different service groups, allowing different customer personas and scenarios to be created and used. You can create many different views that support how you organize your resources.

- **Flexible membership**: Service Groups allow resources from different subscriptions to be grouped together, providing a unified view and management capabilities.

- **Low privilege management**: Service Groups are designed to operate with minimal permissions, ensuring that users can manage resources without needing excessive access rights.

## Create a service group to model your application

To create a service group in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search bar, search for **Service Groups**.

3. Select **+ Add Service Group** to start creating a new group.

4. On the **Basics** tab, provide the required information:

   - **Service Group ID**: Enter a unique identifier for your service group. This ID is used for all commands and references to the group within Azure and can't be changed after creation.

   - **Display Name**: Optionally, enter a display name for the service group. This name appears in the Azure portal and can be updated at any time.

   - **Parent Service Group**: Select the parent service group.

> [!NOTE]
> The root service group is automatically created using the Microsoft Entra ID as its identifier. If you're unsure which parent to select, choose the **Root Service Group**. This group's ID matches your tenant's ID, in the format `Microsoft.Management/serviceGroups[tenantId]`.
